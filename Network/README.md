# Network Tasks I completed at work 

## User failed to access Network. 
- There was a user from different location, on work travel. 
- User couldn't connect to internal network since user's OU is in different group.
- Depending on settings, joining in different OU can cause access error to network. 
- Since user will be back after two weeks, user had to use internal network then use VPN to access internal access. 

## Aruba AP settings
- It was pre-setup before installing to office. 
- Connected Aruba AP(Wi-Fi) device to Switch to gain network connection. 
- Create account and login to Instant On, it's what Aruba created for easy set up. 
- After logging in, add a site then choose location that it will be used. 
- It asks geographic location as latitude and longitude, can be found from google maps. 
- Typed the name and password, if there isn't specific reason it's okay to use default settings.
- Then it will display all of APs that can join to Site, then created. 
- On equipment section, you can edit AP infos each by each, default will be Serial Number.
